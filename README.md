### Welcome! 

Pronouns: she/her/hers

I'm  a **freelance developer** sepcialising in **Graph Databases**, mainly [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) via **.NET**. I've been doing it for 20 years professionally, but waaay longer if we go back in time to the 'pre-getting-paid-for-it' days.

I also manage the [DotNet4Neo4j](https://github.com/dotnet4neo4j) organisation here, so anything .NET/MS/Neo4j feel free to get in touch!

Currently doing an MSc in Health Data Science so getting into `R` and `Python` at the moment 🤷🏻‍♀️

Aaaand as a side to that - I'm heavily focusing on the Bio-Life Sciences side of things - in particular I'm interested in how data can be used to improve Patient lives and outcomes.
